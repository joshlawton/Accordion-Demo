# Summary
An accordion implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript. No external libraries required.

# Requirements
Assume you don’t have access to jQuery. Take a look at the jQuery UI Accordion widget (http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#default). Implement this Accordion widget with your own JavaScript code.

The solution should:
* Animate when you collapse or expand a section
* Leverage basic CSS styling
* Implement appropriate HTML syntax and structure
* Add the current date and time inside of a section using AJAX to call a remote server.

This exercise shouldn’t take more than three hours. The solution doesn’t need to be perfect but needs to demonstrate your problem solving skills.
